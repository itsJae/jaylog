# Motivation

Why I started to build a portfolio website?

* I have wanted my website when I first learned front-end developing.
    
* It’s a hub that connects platforms I use, such as github, leetcode, notion and hashnode blog.
    
* The website also works as an individual workspace where I can record my careers, projects, and tech stacks.
    
* A portfolio website is a great way to show what I have achieved and created so far as a software developer.
    
* I am currently building this website in South Korea military, which means the time and environment is extremely limited. Due to security issues, computers do not store any files and software downloads.
    
    * So I used goorm IDE, which stores source code!

# How I Planned Developing - Overview

If this were a team project or a service, I would adapt agile model for fast developing, and good user experience. However, it’s going to be a website that shows **who I am**, so I have planned it like this:

### 1\. Requirements

* First thing I did was identifying requirements.
    
    * Q. What do I want to show?
        
    * Q. What are some essential sections? - About page & Project page?
        
    * Q. Who are the target audience?
        

---

### 2\. Design

* I used Framer, which is a design and prototyping tool that allows designers to create interactive, high-fidelity prototypes for websites.
    
    * Q. Is it going to be a single-page-application? Or do I want more than one page?
        
    * What are some design requirements?
        
    * Q. What would be a theme color?
        
    * Q. How am I going to design the layout? Flex or Grid?

### 3\. Development

### Front-end

* I was not able to use powerful IDEs, such as VsCode because of working in military. So, I used a cloud IDE like goorm IDE.
    
* I first started to build it with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.
    
    * But then I realized how powerful React.js is. I was copying and pasting tons of elements with just a little change on styles and text.
        
    * With React.js, the website can be more optimized with reusable **components**.
        
* One of my ultimate goals was making interactive websites, having scroll animatoins.
    
    * I used GSAP, which is a JavaScript animation library.
        

### Back-end

* Portfolio websites do not really retrieve data from a server; however, I wanted to have back-ends.
    
    * Brainstorming:
        
        * Chat-bot

### 4\. Review

* Making sure that the code is optimized and organized.
    

---

### 5\. Deployment

* From local to public, I will give the website a domain name.
